###Temboo PHP SDK Examples
The Temboo SDK provides normalized access to 100+ APIs, databases and more so you can spend less time wrestling with API specifics and more time building what matters to you.   

Each example  in this repo is a separate simple app that demonstrates using the Temboo PHP SDK to interact with different 3rd party APIs and services.
